Srikanth,Kavuri,,,,,Student at International Institute of Information Technology.,"""Now what?"" The quintessential fresh graduate question. I walked out of GITAM Hyderabad in May 2013 with a Bachelor's degree in my hand, and that question looping infinitely in my head.  Fast forward three years (and a bit). At TCS, I've had the chance to work with incredibly smart people. All my interactions with them have hammered home one point: ""learning just starts with the Bachelor's degree"". Whether it's working with legacy code, or having to plough through traces to find a fault, or making a Kanban chart, there's always something new around the corner that I have to wrap my head around.  One definite help in that regard is that I prefer working on every component of our product, rather than sticking with one specialty. So there is always an abyss of unknown information to look through whenever an issue arises or a new feature is needed.  My job title says that I am a Systems Engineer. That's a generic title. My job is to start with a requirement description in a document, and flawlessly incorporate that feature into the released product. I also need to maintain existing code, and solve any faults that arise.  Competencies: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby  Outside of work, I enjoy watching cricket and football games, and reading tech happenings and manga. I love all things geeky, cartoony, and chocolatey.",Information Technology & Services,India,500082,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India",,,
